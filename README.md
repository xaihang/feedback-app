## Usage
To add new feedback, follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to the homepage of the Feedback application.
1. You will be directed to a multi-part form where you can leave feedback for the day. The form is divided into four views.
1. Fill out the first view, which asks how you are feeling today. Provide a score between 1 and 5, where 1 is the lowest and 5 is the highest. Click the "next" button to move on to the next view.
1. Fill out the second view, which asks how well you understand the content. Provide a score between 1 and 5. Click the "next" button to move on to the next view.
1. Fill out the third view, which asks how well you are being supported. Provide a score between 1 and 5. Click the "next" button to move on to the next view.
1. Fill out the fourth view, which allows you to leave any additional comments. Click the "next" button to move on to the review page.
1. The review page will display your feedback values, and you can review your responses. You will not be able to change your input on this page.
1. Click the submit button to submit the completed feedback to the server.
1. The application will save the submission in the database, and you will see a submission success page.
1. Click the button to take a new survey if you want to reset all the data and go back to the first step.

Please note that each step of the form will only allow you to advance to the next step if a score was provided. If a score is not provided, you will be prompted to provide a value before moving on to the next step. You're welcome to leave a comment, but it's not required. An empty response is perfectly fine! (^_^)
