1. In the fourth section, leave any additional comments or leave it empty, as it is not required. Then, click the "next" button to proceed to the next section.
1. On the review page, you can review your feedback values, but you will not be able to change your input on this page.
1. Click the "submit" button to submit your completed feedback to the server.
1. The application will save the submission in the database, and you will see a submission success notification.
